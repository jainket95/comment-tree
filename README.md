# Getting Started with Comment Tree

This project was bootstrapped with React Vite Typescript and Mantine

## Project Details

In this project, my aim was to demonstrate the application of the Tree Data Structure by creating a Recursive Component using React and TypeScript.

I embarked on designing a straightforward recursive comment section that leverages a tree data structure. This approach facilitates the organization of comments and their replies in a hierarchical fashion, enabling each comment to act as a parent to multiple replies. Such a setup mimics the nested comment systems observed on platforms like Reddit and various blogging websites, allowing for an intuitive user experience.

To streamline the development process and maintain a focus on the core functionality, I opted to utilize the Mantine UI Library. In my experience, it stands out as an exceptional UI library, offering comprehensive solutions right out of the box. I also incorporated both Dark and Light Mode features to enhance usability.

Given the rising popularity of Vite, I decided to integrate it into the project as well. The entire project is crafted in TypeScript, serving as a testament to my proficiency with the language.
